##Refactoring workshop 2017-01-18
###What is refactoring:
A change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behaviorâ€¦ It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs.
- MartinFowler and Kent Beck, Refactoring book
###Prerequisite:
- tests that exercise and check the behavior!!!
(well, there is a bunch of non changing refactorings...)

###Refactoring examples for:
Replacing conditionals with polymorphism - https://refactoring.com/catalog/replaceConditionalWithPolymorphism.html
Tell Don't Ask - https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html

###Some considerations for Tell-Don't-Ask principle
When to do:
* we see a lot of getters usage
* object seem to be a data structure only, it doesn't contain any behavior
* how veil what

Why to do:
* achieve encapsulation
* make the object API cleaner
* increase object cohesion
* make object usage more readable - hide the internals from the 'outside world'
* make the object more loosely coupled, with well defined contract
* and so on and so forth...

When to consider not to:
* layering concerns (you might be better off with services objects)
* complex/heavyweight object dependencies

Keep in mind:
* Use common sense
* Never blindly follow one principle, many of them might be in conflict depending on the context
* If it helps you, expose getter - there's no harm in doing that!

###Reading recommendations:
Martin Fowler page (https://martinfowler.com/)
Refactoring book (https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672) - plenty of examples!
Refactoring to patterns (https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Patterns-Joshua-Kerievsky/dp/0321213351) - haven't read that, open to feedback whether it's worth reading...
